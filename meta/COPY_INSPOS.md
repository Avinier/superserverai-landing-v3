Timeline: from "2-3 business days" → "15 minutes to receive and review an intelligent optimization plan"

**Optimization Balancing Cost, Capacity, and Performance:**
Recommends infrastructure modifications including instance rightsizing and architectural optimizations based on real-world usage patterns.

**Safe Deployment with Built-in Validation & Rollback:**
Executes changes in phases with real-time monitoring of cost, performance, and capacity metrics.
"8 hours saved per optimization deployment"

### [PROBLEMS ADDRESSED]
1. **Reactive Optimization Burnout** - Teams discover overspending only after billing arrives
